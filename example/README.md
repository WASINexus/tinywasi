# TinyWASI example

This is just a tiny example showing off how to use some of the TinyWASI
functionality.

Call `make` to build the example c++ code.

You need to have a recent enough version clang and the WASI C library installed
and have the `WASI_SYSROOT` path in the Makefile points to the right location.
